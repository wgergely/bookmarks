Running Bookmarks
=================

Bookmarks can be run in two modes. As a standalone application, or embedded into
a compatible PySide2 host environment.

To do so it has to be initialized in :attr:`bookmarks.common.StandaloneMode` or

``embedded`` mode. To start the ``standalone`` app, simply call :func:`bookmarks.exec_`:


.. code-block:: python

    import bookmarks
    bookmarks.exec_()


To run it from a host application, you'll have to first initialize in ``EmbeddedMode``:

.. code-block:: python

    from bookmarks import common
    common.initialize(common.EmbeddedMode)
