This is the developer documentation of Bookmarks' Python modules.

It is generated from the source code automatically and hence might not be complete or
perfectly structured. Still, hopefully, can serve as a guide and reference for future
development work.

If you're looking for the user guide, see the :ref:`Introduction`.
